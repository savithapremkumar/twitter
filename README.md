Poor man's twitter using Django-REST
1. The "backend" project is in Django REST
2. The "frontend" project is written with Vue (CLI install)
3. Both projects run from their specific folders after installation
    i.e. use command ```python3 manage.py runserve``` from the backend folder and ```npm run serve``` from the frontend folder
4. and accessible locally on port 8000 and 8080 respectively
